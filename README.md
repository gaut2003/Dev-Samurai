Dev Samurai
A platform to connect volunteers with local organizations which would allow organizations to post their volunteer needs and for individuals to search and sign up for opportunities based on their skills and interests. Some potential features of this platform could include user profiles, search and filtering options, in-app messaging or scheduling tools, integration with social media platforms, and analytics and reporting tools to track the impact of volunteer work over time.
